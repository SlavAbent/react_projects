    detail: 'Business magnate Peter Weyland speaks with his newly activated android, who chooses the name "David" after observing Michelangelos eponymous statue. Weyland states that one day they will search for mankinds creator together. David comments on his own unlimited lifespan as compared to Weylands, which unsettles Weyland. Eleven years after the Prometheus expedition, the colonization ship Covenant is seven years from reaching planet Origae-6, with 2,000 colonists in stasis and 1,140 human embryos in cold storage. The ship is monitored by Walter, an advanced android model that physically resembles David. When a solar flare[6] damages the ship, Walter reanimates his 14[7] human crewmates, themselves couples and colonists. The ships captain, Jake Branson, is burned alive when his stasis pod malfunctions. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a transmission of a human voice from a nearby planet, which appears eminently more habitable than Origae-6. Despite the protests of Bransons widow, Daniels, that this new "perfect" planet is too good to be true, newly-promoted captain Christopher Oram decides that they will investigate the new planet. With pilot Tennessee maintaining Covenant in orbit, his wife, Maggie, flies a small lander to the Earth-like planets surface where an expedition team tracks the transmissions signal to a crashed alien ship. Crewmates Ledward and Hallett are infected by spores from fungus-like organisms. Orams wife Karine helps the increasingly ill Ledward back to the lander, where Maggie quarantines them inside the med-bay. A small pale alien creature (neomorph) bursts from Ledwards back, killing him, and then mauls Karine to death. Maggie returns and attempts to kill the creature with a shotgun, but inadvertently triggers an explosion which kills her and destroys the lander. Nearby in the fields, another neomorph bursts from Halletts mouth, killing him. The neomorphs attack the remaining crew, killing crew member Ankor. The crew manages to kill one before David, who survived the Prometheus mission, appears and scares off the neomorph. He leads the crew to a temple in a city full of dead humanoids. David tells them that upon his and fellow Prometheus survivor Elizabeth Shaws arrival at the planet, their ship accidentally released a virus which annihilated all fauna on the planet, and that Shaw perished when the ship crashed. Meanwhile, attempts to radio the Covenant are stymied by ion storms. When the remaining neomorph infiltrates the temple and kills crew member Rosenthal, David tries to communicate with the creature, and is incensed when Oram shoots it dead. Oram questions David, who reveals that the Aliens are a result of his releasing and experimenting with the pathogen to produce new lifeforms. He lures Oram into being attacked by a Facehugger Alien. A new form of Alien, the Protomorph, later erupts from Orams chest, killing him. As the others search for Oram and Rosenthal, Walter finds Shaws dissected corpse, used by David as material for his evolving creature designs. David states that humanity is a dying and unworthy species, and his designed creature is a "perfect organism" set to eradicate them. When Walter disagrees, David disables him, then threatens Daniels. Walters advanced systems self-repair, and he engages David while Daniels escapes. Crewmate Cole quickly cuts another facehugger off security chief Dan Lope, leaving Lope with acid burns on his face. The now fully grown protomorph kills Cole while Lope escapes and meets up with Daniels. Tennessee arrives in another lander to extract Daniels, Lope, and Walter, who says David has "expired". They kill the attacking xenomorph and return to Covenant. The next morning, Daniels and Tennessee discover that another xenomorph burst from Lopes chest, killing him, and is loose on the Covenant. It matures and kills crew members Upworth and her husband Ricks. Final crew members Tennessee and Daniels lure the creature into Covenants terraforming bay and kill it.Covenant resumes its voyage to Origae-6. As Walter helps Daniels into stasis, she realizes that Walter is in fact David, but is unable to escape from her pod before falling asleep. David regurgitates two facehugger embryos and places them in cold storage with the human embryos. He poses as Walter to record a log stating that all crew members except Daniels and Tennessee were killed by the solar-flare incident at the beginning of the film and that the ship is still on course for Origae-6.',

The film features returning star Michael Fassbender, with Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, and Demián Bichir in supporting roles. It follows the crew of a colony ship that lands on an uncharted planet and makes a terrifying discovery. In 2012, prior to the release of Prometheus, Ridley Scott discussed the prospects of a sequel and new trilogy, and the film was confirmed that August. Principal photography began on April 4, 2016, at Milford Sound in Fiordland National Park, New Zealand, and wrapped on July 19, 2016. Effects houses Odd Studios and CreatureNFX provided the film's makeup and animatronic creature effects. Scott said that the first cut of the film was two hours and twenty-three minutes long, and was eventually edited down to the two hours and three minutes of the released version. Alien: Covenant premiered in London on May 4, 2017. It was released on May 12 in the United Kingdom, and on May 19 in the United States. The film received generally positive reviews from critics but underperformed at the box office.
